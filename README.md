3. Questions
    - If the democratic process does not produce representive governments in Africa, and the electorate is too poorly educated to hold elected governments accountable, what then are the factors that will solve this issue? What other statistic should I be looking at? What does it take to produce a meritocratic, pragmatic, and honest government?
    - How have other countries who have managed to overcome povertys hift their economy away from agricultural to higher skilled jobs?
    - How have other countries reformed their education?

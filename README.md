> I am studying corruption in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) because I want to find out more about the relationship between corruption and inequality. I am using keyfindings from a corruption survey report to help highlight the context of corruption in SSA as well as gain insight on more specific forms of corruption, such as bribery, embezzlement, and fraud, just to name a few. My visualisation is based on the People and Corruption: Africa Survey 2015 which was jointly released by Transparency International and Afrobarometer. Transparency International is an international non-governmental organisation whose purpose is to combat corruption and prevent criminal activities arising from corruption. Afrobarometer is an African-led series of national public attitude surveys on democracy and governance in Africa.

## Data Review
## 1
**Selected governance indicators for Africa, 2000 and 2012**

A side by side chart that compares how the five main regions in Africa perform against each other on selected governance indicators in 2000 and 2012. The indicators include control of corruption, government effectiveness, regulatory quality, and vice and accountability. Each indicator score ranges from -2.5 to 2.5 with the highest score being the best. At a glance, Southern and West Africa perform much more poorly on these indicators compared to North, East, and Central Africa.

Questions
- If the democratic process does not produce representive and accountable goverment (or good governance) in Africa, what does?
- What causes the governments to become less effective?

**Sectoral breakdown of economic activity in Africa, 1990, 2000 and 2010-2012**

Questions
- How did other developing countries get out of poverty and restructure their economy to a more highly-skilled one?

## 3
**Table 5: Enrolment rates in Africa, 2011**

The table shows the enrolment rates for pre-primary, primary, secondary, and tertiary education in Africa in 2011. At a glance the percentage of people entering tertiary education is extremely low, ranging from 6.88% to 23.03%.

Supplemental Sources
- Median net enrolment rates â€“ the gap between SSA and the rest of the world, 2012
- A bar chart that shows the gap of median enrolment rates of primary and secondary education in SSA in 2012 against the rest of the world. At a glance, the gap between SSA and the rest of the world is lower.

Questions
- How have other countries reformed their education to get out of poverty?

> I am studying good governance in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) because I want to find out more about the relationship between good governance and inequality. I am using indicators from the Worldwide Governance Indicators as to see if the factors affecting good governance have any impact on inequality. My visualisation takes the mean of the governance indicators I have and compares it with the mean gini of all the SSA countries available to see if a pattern exists.

## Data Review
## 1
**Selected governance indicators for Africa, 2000 and 2012**

A side by side chart that compares how the five main regions in Africa perform against each other on selected governance indicators in 2000 and 2012. The indicators include control of corruption, government effectiveness, regulatory quality, and vice and accountability. Each indicator score ranges from -2.5 to 2.5 with the highest score being the best. At a glance, Southern and West Africa perform much more poorly on these indicators compared to North, East, and Central Africa.

**Table 5: Enrolment rates in Africa, 2011**

The table shows the enrolment rates for pre-primary, primary, secondary, and tertiary education in Africa in 2011. At a glance the percentage of people entering tertiary education is extremely low, ranging from 6.88% to 23.03%.

Supplemental Sources

- A bar chart that shows the gap of median enrolment rates of primary and secondary education in SSA in 2012 against the rest of the world. At a glance, the gap between SSA and the rest of the world is lower.

Questions
- How have other countries reformed their education to get out of poverty?

## Data Review
1. Selected Data Sources
    - **Selected governance indicators for Africa, 2000 and 2012**
    
        A side by side chart that compares how the five main regions in Africa perform against each other on selected governance indicators in 2000 and 2012. The indicators include control of corruption, government effectiveness, regulatory quality, and vice and accountability. Each indicator score ranges from -2.5 to 2.5 with the highest score being the best. At a glance, Southern and West Africa perform much more poorly on these indicators compared to North, East, and Central Africa.
